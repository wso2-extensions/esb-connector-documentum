# Documentum Connector

The best way to protect these important assets is to move them to a centralized content management system. Documentum is one of the software that does that all with help of REST API calls. This EI connector enables WSO2 EI to communicate with Documentum Content Management System. It is useful for integrations where you need to store and retrieve information of the enterprise.
